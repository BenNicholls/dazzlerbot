I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep.  And doing a fine job if I do say so myself. 
You sure? 
Not today, guys.  Okay. 
They've got to do something. I was abducted by space aliens ten years ago.  They did all kinds of experiments on me.  They've been studying us for years, learning our weakness.  We've go to do something before they kill us all! 
Just what the hell do you think you're doing? 
You're not going anywhere.  You hear me?  I'm still your father. 
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me. 
When was the last time you had your medicine? 
Miguel?  Come take a look at this. 
You know, you're just like your mother.  She was stubborn too.  I had to twist her arm to get her to take her medicine. 
We should leave too. 
Excuse me Doctor... 
My boy is very sick, he needs immediate attention. 
My boys is slipping into a diabetic coma.  If you don't do something about it right now he will die. 
Just fell asleep.  He's gonna be just fine.  Join me in a little celebration? 
Miguel.  Don't be mad.  Miguel! 
I can fly, I mean, I'm a pilot. 
You don't understand.  I've gotta be part of this.  This is important to me.  They ruined my life. 
Sorry I'm late, Mr. President. 
It's okay, Sir.  I'm packin'. 
Just keep those guys off me for a few more seconds. 
Do me one favor... 
...tell my children I love them very much. 
I've got to, kid.  You were always better at taking care of them than I was anyways.
